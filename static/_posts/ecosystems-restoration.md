We have all heard of the shrewd businessman who bought monkeys from a village with an abundance of them, human beings being opportunists, sold every last one of them. Funny enough, circumstances forced them to rebuy them at an even higher price. Our wealth is in all the living and non-living things in our environment, which make up our ecosystem. It is becoming increasingly vital that we restore the ecosystem. United Nations has declared 2021-2030 as the [UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration](https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/). The goal is to ramp up efforts to reverse centuries of damage on wetlands, forests, and other ecosystems. Restoration is bringing back the ecosystem to what it was. To restore the ecosystem, we need community efforts, group efforts, or individual efforts. We need to partake in projects such as repairing and replanting wetlands, creekbeds, eradicating invasive species, replacing turf grass with native species, planting rain gardens to absorb rainwater running off roofs, or asphalt monitoring ponds and lake habitats.

This year Green Globe Community Based Organization marked World Environment Day by planting trees on the slopes of the Ngong Hills in Kajiado County.

Trees play a vital role in the existence of animals. They absorb carbon from the atmosphere, protect and fertilize soils, supply firewood and timber, and harbor many of the planet’s animals, birds and insects.

This is just a fraction of the lot that Green Globe Community Based Organization does. Our efforts are geared towards better waste management with a specific emphasis on plastic pollution. We educate communities on reducing the use of plastics, recycling, reusing, and refusing single-use plastic such as wrapping paper and straws and training on do-it-yourself (D.I.Y) projects using recycled plastic waste such as the Ottoman and also participating in monthly clean up.

To restore the ecosystem, we need to be persistent and compassionate towards the ecology, unlike the villagers who sold their monkeys only to rebuy at a higher price.
